# Storm-Data-Analysis-
This is a markdown file that contains code to clean and analyze storm data from 1950-2010.
This was a project assigned to me through the Johns' Hopkins Data Science Specialization certificate program.
Links are included in the markdown file for the data and any information about the data and the data fields. 
Some Event type name cleaning was included but misspellings and some inconsistencies with naming were not accounted for.
